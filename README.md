# weather-app
This repo will contain the file for my weather application, i will be using bootstrap and jQuery for this project.

# introduction
The idea for this project was to create a web app in the browser that could search for weather conditions for a searched location using a weather API. The user could search by city and obtain the current weather for the searched location and also see weather conditions for the next 5 days. The results will also show key information such as the temperature, wind speed, humidity.

The initial design for this weather app didnt excited me so i decided to redesign it and create a brand around the idea so i started with some rough sketches before moving on to the rest of the design process, this resulted in the MVP that you can view in this repo.

To create the project i have used bootstrap for the layout and styling an have my own css file to add more details to match my designs. I have also used Jquery, Moment.js and OpenweatherAPI to complete this project.

To improve this project i would create my own icon set for weather conditons, but as of now i have used the icons that are provided by the openweather API. You can see in my HiFi designs what i invision the product to look like.
